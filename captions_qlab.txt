Who?



This is your mother.

His mother!

His mother!

And this
is your father.



Well, you can't marry your own mother. Wedding’s off.



Everyone, wait, I have money to pay off the contract!



You're already
at it!

It's not
what you think!



We tremble
with fury..

Because of
his destiny

Because
of my destiny

Because
of an 
old lady



Calm your fury.
I'm his mother, 
and that makes you 
my daughter!



His mother?

His mother.

His mother.

His mother.

His mother.

His mother.



And this 
is my father

Your father?

His father.

His father.

Etc. etc.



Yes. And this is my mother. Did I mention that?



Our souls hardly know how to resist this moment's...

Sweet 
content.

Fiery
torment.



Darling, look at him, the fruit of our ancient love..

OK, no-one wants
to hear the details. He's my son, so you'll be my wife.



Let's have a double wedding!  Today! Here, have this cheque

And you
should
still have
this cheque...

And this one...

Keep 'em coming 
everyone!  
I can handle it.



Who could be happier than I?

Me.

Me.

Me.



Yes yes, and I'm very pleased for you all. Now back
to my drama. 

Let's fix up your meeting with my husband. Write a note, and we'll add a video...



To a sweet moment, tonight

under the pine wood flats of the garden stage...



The camera, the note... and a rose. That'll do it.



And who is this beautiful extra?

Susanna, don't you think she looks familiar?



Come on, let's finish the shoot, or else, no wrap party, no dancing, and no wedding

Dancing? Your foot is better then?

Could be worse. 
So, back to
filming?



And the kid!
Is he at the war film set?

I'm sure he is.  Places, ladies!

But why did you have his contract?

Who cares?  Old news.  Action!



Let's get this last scene filmed so
they can finally get married!

Direct!



See the film

NrK 1, 21:30



What's this tape?
I think I know
who this is from...

Someone sent him
a sex tape? That'll
put him in a good
mood…

Might get done
today after all!



OK everyone, let's finish this up!

Then we really will have a wedding night we'll all remember..



Bla, Bla,

The Droit

De Seigneur,

bla,

it's a wrap!








What's wrong?



Don't jump to conclusions.
You can't be sure who's playing who...



It's her.
There's no doubt about it.
They're going to meet
on the garden stage...



Where are you going?

To take revenge
for all husbands!



No, I don't believe
Susanna would do this.



Why is it only when
we're not in competition
that we women
stick up for each other?



What's with the long face?



My faithful wife and my boss.
Having their own little party..



Guess my services as match-maker are no longer required then?



You guys stay right here and wait for my signal.



Susanna's got a
special meeting
with the boss and
Figaro doesn't like it.



Why should he have to put up with it?

Other people put up with it all the time.



In this world my friend,
powerful people
get what they want.
If you stand in the way,
you get run over.



Everything is ready.



Some
wedding night...



How could you?
In the ceremony
I was laughing, but really I was the joke.



Susanna! Your face,
your innocent eyes,
I still can't believe it...



Anyone that 
trusts a woman
is an idiot!



Open your eyes.
See women
for what they are

These
you call goddesses..


witches
who enchant
to cause us
pain

sirens
that sing
to land us
on the rocks

comets
that shine
to burn out 
our eyes



thorny roses

charming
vixens

smiling
bears

cruel
doves

mistresses
of intrigue



they feign

they lie

they feel
no love

they feel
no pity



Everyone.
Knows.
This.



Figaro's coming!

One is hiding,
listening, the other
is on his way.
Let's start.

I’ll hide…



I'm cold, aren't you?

Yes. I 
will go
to bed.

I'll stay out a bit longer.



I'll teach them
both a lesson.



At last I can enjoy
my lover’s embrace,
unhurried 



Oh, come,
don't delay,

beautiful
joy

come where
love calls you



Come,
my love

among these
hidden trees

I want to
crown you
with roses



I think
that's Susanna

The kid!



Let's get
a little
closer..

Get out of here
you little idiot,
you'll ruin
everything!



Here’s my little Susanna



She's with
another man!
Is it the kid?

She's with
another man!
Is it the kid?

She's with
another man!
Is it the
kid?



A little kiss?

You little...

You
little...

You
little...



!



Everyone is
on their way

to learning
a valuable
lesson



Here I am. 
See anything
you like?

What an obliging little wife!



Such
soft
skin...

He doesn't know
what he's doing

He can't 
help himself.



Wait!
Here, have this
highly identifiable
ring.



Everything
is going well,
but the best
is yet to come

Everything
is going well,
but the best
is yet to come



Let's go
somewhere
more private..

It's so dark
in there!

We're not going in
to read a book..



It's Figaro!
I have to go.

Stay right here.
I'll take care of it...



So, beautiful Venus has come to meet proud Mars…

But wily Vulcan
will catch them
in his net!



Rosina! Look!
My wife, your husband -
come here, I'll show you



Shh!  Listen,
come over here,
Um, I want 
revenge!



Susanna!


Revenge you say?



I'll trick him!

I'll trick her!



Here I am
at your feet,
my heart full
of jealous fire...

think
of your
treacherous
husband...



Give me
your hand...

Here!



Take that!

And that!

And that!

And that!

And that!

It's
a bit early
for S&M!

I'll teach
you to play
Don Juan!



You think I wouldn't
recognise your
beautiful voice?

OK. 
Let's
pretend
it never
happened.



Where's she gone?
Susanna?



Great, he didn't recognise her.

Who?

Rosina!



Show
must go on,
I guess.



My
leading
lady...

Here I am,
do what
you want!



Everybody
out here now!

Look at this traitor! Guess who I caught him with?



Out you get. There's no hiding now!

The kid!

My mother!

Rosina!



Here she is, my treacherous wife.



Forgive me!


No, never!

Forgive
us!

Never!

Forgive
them!


No,

no,

no!



Maybe I can convince you?





Forgive me

my love.

I am more gentle, and say yes, I forgive you.




And the moral of the story is...



“Neither extramarital affairs, nor petty jealousy, ever end well”



“But if you do start an affair, hopefully some complicated disguise-based shenanigans will help you realise who you really love, before you do anything you'll regret.”



“Finally, one excellent way of getting out of an arranged marriage is to realise that your spouse-to-be is directly related to you.”



THE END
