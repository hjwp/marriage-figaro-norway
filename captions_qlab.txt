> And the moral of the story is...



> “Neither extramarital affairs, nor petty jealousy, ever end well”



> “But if you do start an affair, hopefully some complicated disguise-based shenanigans will help you realise who you really love, before you do anything you'll regret.”



> “Finally, one excellent way of getting out of an arranged marriage is to realise that your spouse-to-be is directly related to you.”



> THE END
