> Why wouldn't you want the best caravan on location?

> Yeah.  And when Almaviva sends you off to buy 1000 brown M&Ms or whatever, he'll be right at my door



> What are you saying?

> I'm trying

> Almaviva is tired of sleeping with wannabe actresses, and is turning his attention to the crew...



> Who?

> Who do you think?



> That's the whole point of this flashy caravan. He wants me close by.

> If Susanna refuses Almaviva, he'll derail the wedding, then Figaro will be mine!



> Leave it to me. I'll make some calls.

> Unless Rosina intervenes,

> You'll never see me again? Isn't Rosina the one you're always pining for?



> I wish I were in your place; you get to dress her in the morning, undress her in the evening...

> Know what I mean?



> Get out, 
> you vile panderer

> I'd have thought you'd prefer an affair with the boss...



> What's this tape?



> Is it for you, or is it one of his tributes to our leading lady?



> Go sell it to the National Enquirer!



> Hey I'm just repeating what everyone's saying!

> And what

> You know my rule about on-set relationships! Where is that kid?



> Ah, sorry, I obviously came at a bad time...

> OK. You want to learn the business?
> You can be an extra for my war film epic in Belgium.

> You'll leave

> How long has this been going on?

> It hasn't!



> But he tried to seduce you?



> It's not about seduction;
> I'm only a make-up girl, 
> just another notch on his bedpost.



> He doesn't love me any more!

> Then why is he so jealous?



> Men!  They're all the same.

> Oh, but Figaro is different...



> How’s it hanging ladies?

> How can you joke about this!



> I can make jokes and come up 
> with brilliant plans at the same time!

> I've left Basilio a letter,
> ostensibly written by Rosina to a lover.



> But my husband is so jealous!

> Exactly! Makes him more likely to fall for it.
> A little taste of his own medicine…



> What about Marcellina?

> But wait, there's more! We say you’ll meet him tonight.




> But we send Cherubino, dressed up as you, and then 




> let his leading lady catch him in the act.



> I… guess so?



> Good. I'll send Cherubino up,
> and you take care of the disguises.



> Then what?

> Then me and the boss,

> we're gonna dance.



> I can’t believe Cherubino witnessed my husband, with you…

> Hey, what's this other tape?

> We'll make him show us.



> Come on in John Snow!

> Don’t remind me! I’m just sad to be away from such an amazing actress



> And beautiful too...

> Well.  Sure…

> “well, sure” indeed! 
> Why don't you show us your film?



> Who is the director?

> He's the one currently blushing.



> You who know what love is

> Look

> to see 

> if I have it in my heart.




> I didn't know you were
> such an auteur!

> Yes he takes it very seriously.
> That and coffee and fixed-wheel bikes.



> You do have quite a feminine build don't you?



> What if someone comes in?

> I'll lock the door.




> What are we going to do with this hair?

> I have some hair extensions.  In the wardrobe.



> It's my contract for the war film.

> Looks like they forgot to sign it.



> I'm almost jealous. Stop being so beautiful!



> Enough messing about. Get the dress!



> I wonder if the boss has seen "the Crying Game"



> Go to wardrobe and get him something more... retro.



> Susanna's laughing at me. And I have to leave, so soon...

> Oh you poor kid. What bad luck.



> These might be our last moments together...



> My husband!

> And you here!

> And he'll have read Figaro's letter!



> Who are you talking to?

> Um, to no-one. To you?

> I'm going to hide.
> That's worked well 
> every time so far.



> Since when do you lock doors?

> I was just changing...



> ... Changing costumes!
> With Susanna.
> She’s gone to Wardrobe.



> Let's talk about this letter!



> I didn't hear anything!

> Because there's something else on your mind?



> Maybe it's Susanna?

> Who you just told
> me went off to the 
> wardrobe department?

> Well, either there, 
> or to the wardrobe 
> in here. I didn't specify.



> You're all flustered about something

> You're the one that's all flustered,
> about my make-up girl!



> Let's just see shall we?



> She can't come out! She's 
> trying on her wedding outfit!



> I'm sure

> she  has

> a lover in there!

> I’m sure this
> is going to end badly



> I’m sure Cherubino
> was in here?



> If she can't come out,
> she can still answer some questions! 



> Careful, my wife…

> Careful, my husband…

> Careful!

> Careful!

> Confusion

> and

> scandal

> loom over us



> If you won't open it,
> I'll get someone who will!

> You want everyone
> to know our business?



> Fine.  I'll open it myself.
> Let's lock this door, and go fetch some tools.



> After you, Scarlett O'Hara.



> See you when we get back, "Susanna"!



> It's locked!

> He'll kill me if he finds me!

> He'll kill you if he finds you!

> That's the garden stage      down there



> It's too high!

> At worst I'll break a couple of prop flowers.
> Don't worry!

> If I don't make it,     tell Rosina                  I love her.



> Off he runs. Thank goodness he's all right.



> Everything is as we left it.
> Last chance, you wanna open this door?



> You really think I've been cheating?



> I'll find out who's in there, one way or another.

> Yes you'll see him, but -

> Him?  So it's not Susanna!



> We were just planning a joke, it's totally innocent!



> Who's in there? I'll kill him!

> It's a boy...



> Him again!  I am cursed to have that boy permanently underfoot?



> You're scaring me!

> Speak up!



> There's a perfectly good explanation for this,
> but he's not...


> but he's not... he's in his underwear.



> Because we were dressing him up as a girl!

> Yeah, I know exactly what you were up to.



> Give me the key!

> He's innocent. You know...



> Get out of here,

> I never want to see you again,

> and take your crap with you!



> I'm not guilty!



> I'll kill him.

> I'll kill him.


> And  that

> will be the end of all this.

> Jealousy consumes him.



> Here I am.

> If you're going to kill anyone,

> it'll have to be me.



> You're alone?

> See for yourself.



> He's OK. He jumped out of the window.


> Clearly I owe you an apology.

> But this was some joke!



> You don't deserve forgiveness.

> You don't deserve forgiveness.



> I love you!

> You're full of it!



> Susanna, help me out here...

> You're on your own!



> This is what I get for being true?



> Forgive you? You were
> about to kick me out!

> I'll make it up to you,
> I promise...

> Maybe you should give him a break?



> I shouldn’t have to put up with this.



> What was all that crap about the kid?

> That was just a test.

> You seemed truly upset though!

> I am an actress.



> But that letter was a low blow...

> Figaro wrote it and handed it to Basilio...

> So everyone was in on it!



> Forgiveness is not due          to those            who     don't give it.



> I'm not strong enough to stay angry with him...

> I guess some men just always             get away  with it,          don't they?



> I was wrong.
> I’m sorry.

> From this moment

> may these two souls

> live in

> greater harmony



> Come on, everything's ready for us to finish the shoot.



> Not so fast...

> How do you 
> explain 
> this note?

> I don't know anything about it!



> Are you sure you didn't give it to Basilio?

> And our plans with the kid, remember?

> Nope.  I know nothing.



> I can read it on your face. You're lying.

> Think what you like. I'm not lying.

> It's no use Figaro,

> we already told him...



> So you admit it?

> I admit nothing!

> Come on, the game's over!



> This is Hollywood.

> It's not over

> until

> the big wedding at the end.

> Get Marcellina
> in here now!




> What now?

> I saw someone jump out of this window!

> They smashed my prop flowers!



> Someone jumped?  Where did they go?

> I don't know, he got away.

> It's OK, I saw him too.



> Buddy, you're high on paint fumes...



> He's tripping!

> He's tripping!



> Did you see his face?

> No.



> Don't get so worked up over a few flowers.

> I admit it. It was me.



> Didn't seem so tall when he jumped...

> That's what happens when you jump out a window!



> I thought it was the kid...

> Probably came back to pick up his fixed-wheel bike.

> I didn't see no bike jumping through the window!



> All right.  Finish the story.

> So, I jumped...

> But why?



> Right.

>  I was hoping to…

> catch a kiss

> from my  wife-to-be, and then I...

> heard a noise? and...

> panicked and jumped out of the window, and...

> and I twisted my ankle!

> ow.



> So these would be your papers that you dropped then?

> Oh fuck.



> So what are these papers?

> I have so many... One second...



> Maybe it's a list of his unpaid debts!

> Maybe it's a list of your favourite huffing solvents!



> You, start talking. And you, get out of here.

> I'm going. But I think everyone should
> have a little more respect for the props.



> Of course! It's the kid's contract. 
> He gave it to me. Because...

> The signature!


> It needs your signature.



> I have no idea what's going on

> We might just get away with this...

> I have almost no idea what's going on.



> Hang on, we're here, just in time!

> What are these three idiots doing here?



> Hang on, let's hear them out!



> I have a marriage contract here
> (they're very common in Hollywood)
> saying that Figaro must marry me!



> I am teh lawyer.
> Fully legit.



> I can be a character witness.
> I know all about Figaro's debts.



> Pipe down everyone!
> I'll make sure we get to the bottom of this.



> Confusion! Shock! Desperation!

> Fortune!  Happy chance!

> What kindly spirit 

> What demon from hell 

> sent those three here?

> sent us here?

> sent them here?
